RGSoC 2017 is upon us and we are down for another awesome round of being a
coaching company in our office in Berlin-Mitte. We're a bit late – what with
the application deadline fast approaching – but please contact us for some
Ruby and JavaScript on-site coaching this summer.

[Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org) (»RGSoC«) is a three-month
scholarship to allow women to work on Open Source projects fulltime and by this, fostering
diversity in Open Source culture.

ABSOLVENTA's development team is completely in <3 with the program since its first
edition back in 2013 where we coached a team of [two super awesome
women](http://highwaytorails.tumblr.com). Last year we were again blessed
with a wonderful team of RGSoC students: the amazing [Team
Joda](https://twitter.com/teamjoda2016).

We're a bit late to the party compared to [last year's announcement](/2016/02/25/we-want-to-work-with-you-during-rgsoc-2016/)
but here it goes: We totally want to do this again!

<div class="alert">We already have a team of students and are looking forward to host
<a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/339">Team berlin diamonds</a>
this summer. Fingers crossed!</div>

If you are Berlin-based and would like to apply for this year's RGSoC, we want to be your
[»coaching company«](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company).
What we can offer:

* Desk space in our office at Friedrichstrasse (if needed: iMac included)
* A team of six Ruby/Rails/JS devs to coach you
* An inclusive culture and a super friendly work-atmosphere

While Rails Girls Summer of Code is language agnostic and there is indeed a host of
[accepted projects](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects) that are non-Ruby
ones, we can only really coach Ruby and Rails projects (together with JS and CSS magic):
this is where we have knowledge to share.

We are happy to assist in any (Ruby)project you wish, but you may want to consider
applying for the [RGSoC Teams App](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/106-rails-girls-summer-of-code-the-teams-app):
Yours truly ended up being on the RGSoC Core team in 2014 and so the mentor of
that project could potentially sit right next to you*.

So, if you are interested: please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:carsten.zimmermann@absolventa.de">get
in touch</a> – we are looking forward to hearing from you!

<small>*) That being said, applying for the RGSoC Teams App and with ABSOLVENTA as a
coaching company doesn't mean that your application will automatically be accepted.</small>

PS: If you're not interested in applying for the Summer of Code but are otherwise interested
in supporting the program, we have a [crowdfunding program](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) running :)
