[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org) (»RGSoC«) is a three-month
scholarship to allow women to work on Open Source projects fulltime and by this, fostering
diversity in Open Source culture.

ABSOLVENTA's dev team is completely in <3 with the program since its first edition back in 2013
where we coached a team of [two super awesome women](http://highwaytorails.tumblr.com).
It was (and still is) so great to see how the summer of 2013 became the start of two new careers
in web development.

We totally want to do this again!

If you are Berlin-based and would like to apply for this year's RGSoC, we want to be your
[»coaching company«](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company).
We can offer you:

* Desk space in our office at Friedrichstrasse (if needed: iMac included)
* A team of six Ruby/Rails/JS devs to coach you
* An inclusive culture and a super friendly work-atmosphere

While Rails Girls Summer of Code is language agnostic and there is indeed a host of
[accepted projects](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects) that are non-Ruby
ones, we can only really coach Ruby and Rails projects (together with JS and CSS magic):
this is where we have knowledge to share.

We are happy to assist in any (Ruby)project you wish, but you may want to consider
applying for the [RGSoC Teams App](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/106-rails-girls-summer-of-code-the-teams-app):
Yours truly ended up being on the RGSoC Core team in 2014 and so the mentor of
that project would sit right next to you*.

So, if you are interested: please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:carsten.zimmermann@absolventa.de">get
in touch</a> – we are looking forward to hearing from you!

<small>*) That being said, applying for the RGSoC Teams App and with ABSOLVENTA as a
coaching company doesn't mean that your application will automatically be accepted.</small>

PS: If you're not interested in applying for the Summer of Code but are otherwise interested
in supporting the program, we have a [crowdfunding program](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) running :)
