teaser: "Vim is the goto editor for about half our team. Inviting the friendly people of <a href='//vimberlin.de'>Vim Berlin</a> over was only natural. It wasnâ€™t overly crowded, but cancelling wasn't an option without being laughed at by the Emacs folks who met the same day."

Robin, Markus and I are all avid [Vim](http://vim.org) users. We invited Berlin's user group over
to hold their first meeting in 2014 in our kitchen slash leisure zone. It wasn't overly crowded,
but as pointed out by [Bodo](//tasche.me), canceling it wasn't an option: the Emacs user group
Berlin had a meeting on the same day and we would have been laughed at.

Although there were no prepared talks, we had a good time: We talked about the progress being made
on [Neovim](//neovim.org), discussed a highly customised and plugin-rich `.vimrc` vs. vanilla Vim
and had a look at Christian's vim config.

A nice and cosy evening that, yet again, got everyone a few more plugins to try out.
